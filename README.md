# Refactoring test in C#

## Description

You are asked to refactor the SignupService class and, more specifically, its AddUser method. 
Assume that the code is sound in terms of business logic and only focuses on applying clean code principles. Keep in mind acronyms such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.

The reason for the refactor is we like to add Push as a notification service.

Try to keep this exercise below 2 hours. If you still have things you can improve after the 2-hour mark, please write them down, and we will take them into account.

## Limitations
The Program.cs class in the LegacyApp.Consumer shall NOT CHANGE AT ALL. This includes using statements. Assume that this codebase is part of a greater system, and any non-backward compatible change will break the system. Any change in that class will result in you instantly failing this test.

You can change anything in the LegacyApp project except for the:
UserDataAccess class and its AddUser method. Both the class and the method NEED to stay static.
EmailService class and its Send method. Both the class and the method NEED to stay static.
SmsService class and its Send method. Both the class and the method NEED to stay none static.

## NOTE
 --> Maria Doe is currently throwing an exception because it used the new Push notifications we like to add; this must be fixed.
 --> Mike Doe is currently throwing an exception due to it used the new BottleMail notifications; this must still throw an exception

## Hint
We would like, in the long run, to be able to add additional notifications options.
You should Test your implementation if business logic is still working.
